**3. ELIGIBILITY:**

**4. HOW TO ENTER:**
There are two (2) methods of entry. Limit one (1) entry per person, per wallet address, regardless of the method of entry.

*   **(A) Automatic Entry via Prediction:**
    During the Promotion Period, place a prediction of any size (either "YES" or "NO") on the official **"Will Jeff Bezos or Lauren S치nchez file for divorce by Dec 31, 2025?"** market on the PiOracle.online platform. Upon successful confirmation of your prediction on the blockchain, you will automatically receive one (1) entry into the Sweepstakes drawing pool associated with the outcome you predicted (the "YES Pool" or the "NO Pool").

*   **(B) Free Entry by Online Form (No Purchase Necessary):**
    To enter without making a prediction, complete the official free entry form with your full name, email address, and Polygon/BNB wallet address.

**5. WINNER SELECTION:**
After the associated prediction market is officially resolved, one (1) potential winner will be selected in a random drawing from all eligible entries in the drawing pool corresponding to the **winning outcome** of the market (e.g., if the market resolves to "YES", the winner will be drawn from the "YES Pool"). The drawing will be conducted by the Sponsor, whose decisions are final. The odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries received for the winning outcome pool.
