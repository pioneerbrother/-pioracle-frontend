Crypto markets were rocked today as OKX, a leading global exchange, dropped a bombshell announcement: multiple trading pairs will be delisted on **June 20, 2025**, between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM UTC.

The news sent shockwaves through the crypto community, causing a surge of speculation and leaving many Pi Network (Pİ) holders anxiously asking the same question: **Is Pİ being delisted?**

### The Delisting List

According to the official announcement from OKX, the following trading pairs will be removed:

*   ALCX/USDT, ALCX/USD
*   NULS/USDT, NULS/USD
*   MDT/USDT, MDT/USD
*   BORA/USDT, BORA/USD
*   CTXC/USDT, CTXC/USD
*   XNO/USDT, XNO/USD
*   VENOM/USDT, VENOM/USD
*   RADAR/USDT, RADAR/USD

### Pİ Holders, Breathe Easy!

Here’s the good news that cuts through the noise: **Pi Network’s Pİ token is NOT on the delisting list.**

OKX has confirmed that all Pİ trading pairs, including Pİ/USDT, Pİ/USD, Pİ/TRY, Pİ/EUR, and Pİ/BRL, remain safe and fully operational on the exchange. Pi continues to be a significant asset on the platform, boasting a market cap of over $34 billion and a price hovering around $49 as of earlier this year.

### What Should You Do?

While the Pi community can be relieved, holders of the affected tokens must act quickly. OKX strongly urges users to cancel any open orders for the delisted pairs before the June 20th deadline. Any orders left open will be automatically canceled by the system, a process which could take 1–3 business days and potentially disrupt your trading plans.

Note that deposits for these tokens were already halted on June 16th, and withdrawals will officially cease on **September 20, 2025**.

### Why the Change?

OKX stated that the move is part of their regular process to maintain a "robust spot trading environment" and to "optimize liquidity" for their users. This kind of portfolio management is a common and healthy practice for major exchanges in the fast-paced crypto world.

For Pi enthusiasts, this news is a powerful signal of stability. While other projects are being removed, Pi remains a cornerstone of OKX’s offerings.
