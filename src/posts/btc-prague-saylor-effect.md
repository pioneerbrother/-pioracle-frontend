All eyes in the crypto world turn to Prague this week for Europe's largest Bitcoin conference. With headline speakers like Michael Saylor and Adam Back set to take the stage, the air is thick with anticipation.

Major conferences have historically been pivotal moments for market sentiment. They can ignite bull runs with groundbreaking announcements or trigger sell-offs as traders capitalize on the hype. Will the discussions in Prague generate enough bullish momentum to push Bitcoin to new heights, or will it be a classic "sell the news" event?

We're not just discussing itâ€”we're forecasting it. We have just launched a new prediction market on PiOracle asking the critical question:

**Will the price of Bitcoin (BTC) close above $110,000 on June 22nd, the day after the conference ends?**

This is your chance to put your analysis to the test. Do you believe in the "Saylor Effect," where the influence of major players can move the market, or do you think the price is due for a correction after its recent run-up?

Weigh the sentiment of the crowd, and make your prediction now.
