                    <h2>For Predictors: How to Make Your Predictions</h2>
                    <p>Ready to turn your insights into potential profit? Hereâ€™s how:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Get Set Up on Polygon:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Wallet:</strong> You'll need a Polygon-compatible crypto wallet. We recommend MetaMask (a browser extension or mobile app).</li>
                                <li><strong>MATIC:</strong> Ensure you have some MATIC tokens in your wallet. MATIC is used for placing predictions and for paying small network transaction fees (gas) on the Polygon network. You can acquire MATIC from most major cryptocurrency exchanges.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Connect Your Wallet:</strong>
                            Visit <Link to="/">pioracle.online</Link>. Click the "Connect Wallet" button, usually found at the top right of the page, and approve the connection in your wallet.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Browse Open Markets:</strong>
                            Navigate to the "<Link to="/predictions">Open Markets</Link>" section. Here you'll see all currently active prediction markets. Each market will clearly state the question, the target outcome, and when betting closes (the expiry time, shown in UTC).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Make Your Prediction:</strong>
                            Click on a market you're interested in. Decide if you predict "YES" (the condition will be met) or "NO" (it won't). Enter the amount of MATIC you wish to stake. For price-based markets, if the current live price already makes one outcome a certainty, that option will be disabled to ensure fair predictions. Click "Submit Prediction."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Confirm in Your Wallet:</strong>
                            Your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) will pop up asking you to confirm the transaction. This will include your stake amount and a small Polygon network gas fee. Review and confirm.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Check Back & Claim Winnings:</strong>
                            Once a market's betting period ends and the outcome is officially determined, the market will be resolved. Visit the "<Link to="/resolved-markets">Recently Resolved Markets</Link>" page or your "<Link to="/my-predictions">My Predictions</Link>" page. If your prediction was correct, a "Claim Winnings" button will be available. Click it, confirm the gas fee, and your winnings will be sent directly to your wallet!
                        </li>
                    </ol>
